# Building a Network Monitoring Agent using Google Cloud

## Overview

This article provides a basic framework for building a lightweight remote network monitoring agent, using Google Cloud to ingest the data, visualize it and manage the overall solution.  The reason for building this was to learn about various cloud-native features.

## Objectives

Here are the deliverables for this project:
- Run a process on a remote agent to gather network performance metrics
- Manage the agent operations from a central console (start/stop/update)
- Securely transmit data to a central data store
- Visualize data to show historical performance
